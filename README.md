# Adeept Custom Spider
An Arduino learning project based on Adeept Spider Robot. After ordering and assembling the kit, one is naturally curious what it can do. 

## Installation
Assemble the frame with six legs. Don't bother adding head, sensors, buzzers, etc. This project is mainly about kinetics (ability to move), so the simpler - the better.

Download the Arduino IDE and run trough the sketches. Pay attention to how I have wired my robot. My pins are different form what the instructions says.
