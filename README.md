# Adeept Custom Spider
An Arduino learning project based on [Adeept Spider Robot](https://www.adeept.com/adeept-hexapod-6-legs-spider-robot-kit-for-arduino-uno-r3-and-nano-with-20pcs-sg92r-servo-motor-24g-wireless-remote-control-obstacle-avoidance_p0089_s0021.html). After ordering and assembling the kit, one is naturally curious what it's true capabilities are. The default control logic (looks at "Adeept6LegSpiderRobot.ino") seems poorly written. So I've started my own "sketches" folder to explore different implementation. 

## Installation
Assemble the frame with six legs. Don't bother adding head, sensors, buzzers, etc. This project is mainly about kinetics (ability to move), so the simpler - the better.

Examine my sketches, hopefully you will find ideas of how to do things better.
